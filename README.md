## Issue/ Problem
Salifort Motors seeks to improve employee retention and answer the following question:
Whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company

- The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked.

## To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to the stakeholders:

- Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
- Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied.
- Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so.
- If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear.
- Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts.
- High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
